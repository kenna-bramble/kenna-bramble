## ✨ Hello! ✨ My name is McKenna. 
I am a **Frontend Developer** based in Ypsilanti, Michigan. 

### About Me

🙂 My pronouns are **_she/her/hers_**. 

💻 I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I’m currently learning React. It has been a PROCESS but I am close to completing the [skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) React course! 

✒️ I am a [skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) student and I blog about my tech journey on [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/mckennabramble). 

🔭 I am searching for my first job in tech as a Frontend Developer at a **remote-first** company. 

📫 You may reach me via [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/mckenna-bramble

⚡ Fun Fact: Pre-pandemic I did kickboxing 🥊 but I am now very out of practice. Hopefully soon I can find a local place to get back into it!
