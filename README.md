## ✨ Hello! ✨ My name is McKenna. 

I have always dreamt of being a Lisbeth Salander-esque hacker 🐉 who lives off of bagels and a lack of sleep, but I am gluten intolerant and you will _not_ see me hacking corrupt corporations on less than 8 hours of precious sleep thank you very much. So, I have settled for the less glamorous but more sustainable career as a **Frontend Developer** and **UX Designer**! 

### About Me

🙂 My pronouns are **_she/her/hers_**. 

✒️ I am a [skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/) student and I blog about my tech journey on [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/mckennabramble). 

💻 My languages/libraries include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

🎨 I design logos, websites, print publications, etc. using Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Figma. 

🔭 I am searching for my first job in tech as a Frontend Developer / Software Engineer at a **remote-first** company.
